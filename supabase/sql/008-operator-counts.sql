-- 008 — operators record sacks and weight after harvesting and drying
--       (Ticket 22)
--
-- Run this ONCE in the Supabase dashboard, after 007:
--   Supabase -> SQL Editor -> New query -> paste -> Run
--
-- Safe to run twice. This is the 006 update guard with ONE change: an
-- Operator may now also change `sacks` and `kilos` (they count and weigh
-- after harvesting and after drying). Every other rule is unchanged, and
-- Operators still cannot touch money, choices, buyouts or requests.
